# Dawid, J. Blom
#### Embedded Software Engineer


## PROFILE
I am an embedded software engineer with over 3 years of experience, focusing
on building robust, deterministic, and maintainable systems. I work across the
full lifecycle of software, from low-level implementation to system-level design,
and place a high value on correctness, reliability, and long-term sustainability. I
approach development with an engineering mindset, emphasizing clear
architecture, disciplined software practices, and thoughtful problem-solving.


## EMPLOYMENT
### Embedded Software Designer
#### Trojan Technologies, London, ON, Canada								2023 - Present    

At Trojan Technologies, I work as an Embedded Software Designer developing
real-time control systems for industrial ultraviolet water treatment products. I
design, develop, and integrate control logic for an expandable embedded
platform that enables plug-and-play functionality across current and future
product lines. The primary technologies used include ZephyrRTOS, MCUboot,
C, C++, Python, and NXP’s i.MX RT1062 ARM microcontroller.

My work includes:

- Designing and implementing real-time task execution using ZephyrRTOS
- Configuring MCUboot to support secure firmware update workflows
- Implementing sensor data acquisition via SPI, I²C, UART/RS485, ADC, and
  TCP/IP interfaces
- Developing control logic for ultraviolet dose pacing, lamp wiper control, and
  system monitoring
- Contributing to system architecture to ensure loose coupling of I/O, CPU,
  and memory operations within a distributed closed-loop control
  environment
  
In addition to technical contributions, I identified gaps in the use of disciplined
software engineering practices and helped introduce test-driven development,
code coverage metrics, static code analysis, and model-based systems
engineering. These efforts improved software quality, consistency, and long-
term maintainability across the firmware team.


### Embedded Software Designer Intern
#### Trojan Technologies, London, ON, Canada								2022 - 2023 

At Trojan Technologies, I worked as an Embedded Software Designer Intern
supporting improvements to legacy industrial control systems for ultraviolet
water treatment products. Working primarily with C and Python, I collaborated
with experienced engineers to analyze system architectures, evaluate systembehavior, 
conduct Voice of Customer (VoC) sessions, and build prototypes to validate design 
concepts within the constraints of deployed systems. This role strengthened my 
systems thinking, collaborative engineering skills, and ability to translate 
customer feedback into technical solutions.

### Software Engineer
#### KeepIn, Sete Lagoas, MG, Brasil										2021 - 2022

At KeepIn, I worked as a Software Engineer on a home automation mobile
application, contributing to the enhancement and stabilization of a large legacy
codebase developed in Delphi. I implemented new features, integrated device
communication using HTTPS, MQTT, and Infrared (IR), and collaborated across
application and device-integration layers to improve reliability, performance, and
overall user experience while maintaining backward compatibility. The primary
technologies used included Delphi and SQL with SQLite3.
	

## PERSONAL PROJECTS
### Invoicing System Project 2025
I designed and developed a Linux-based invoicing application used in
production by two small businesses in South Africa, T.M Engineering and T.C
Engineering. The system supports invoice and statement creation, PDF
generation, printing, and email distribution, and was built to address real
operational needs within the mechanical engineering sector.
	
Through this project, I intentionally explored technologies outside my primary
professional stack, including GTKMM, CairoMM, and Poppler for GUI and
document generation, SQLite3 for persistent storage, and libcurl for email
delivery. The project emphasized clean architecture, maintainability, and reliable
automation workflows while independently learning and integrating unfamiliar
technologies.
