- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dawid.

-    I am interested in embedded real-time, hard and soft, as well as bare metal embedded systems.
-    Additionally, I enjoy working on Linux as a desktop or with RT_Preemtpatch as an RTOS.
- 
-    Currently, I'm studying towards my bachelors of science in computer science at 
-    University of The People. Additionally, furthering my knowledge of embedded systems design and software
-    engineering.
-    
-    As for now, I do not collaborate on any open source projects, but rather I am developing my own. 
-    However, I would like to collaborate on aerospace embedded system technologies.
