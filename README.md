- 👋 Hi, I’m Dawid.


- 👀 I am interested in embedded real-time, hard and soft, as well as well as embedded systems.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying towards my bachelors of science in computer science at 
- 
-    University of The People, as well as furthering my knowledge of embedded systems design and software
-    
-    engineering.
-    
- 💞️ Currently, I do not collaborate on any open source projects, but rather I am developing my own.
